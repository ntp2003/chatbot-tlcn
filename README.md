# ðŸ“¦ Chatbot for Product Search & MQL-to-SQL Conversion

This chatbot is designed to support customers in searching for phones/laptops, consulting sales policies, and recommending suitable products.
It leverages the RAG method, multi-agent systems, etc., to understand user intent and generate responses.

The system plays a key role in converting **Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL)** into **Sales Qualified Leads (SQL)** by:

* Identifying interest through product-related queries.
* Nurturing leads via contextual product recommendations.
* Collecting contact information when provided by the user and forwarding it to the Customer Support department via email.
